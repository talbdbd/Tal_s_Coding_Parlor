# Tal's Coding Parlor

## Description

The goal of this project was to create a professional online portfolio.

- My motivation was to make a professional portfolio that looks polished and easy to navigate.
- I built this project to further my career by allowing easy access to the breadth of my coding skills.
- The main solutions I strove for were two fold: easy to navigate UI and easy to build structure for the addition future project showcases.
- My main learning experience from this project was how effectively design an online portfolio that would be easy to do to later on.
